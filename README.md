### üå± Always learning something new!

‚ö° I am a full-stack software engineer especially interested in building simple and fast software, scaling systems up, and shipping reliable applications. I am deeply interested in the intersection of developer ergonomics, runtime efficiency and fault tolerance. My most productive programming language is Ruby. However, being a polyglot, I am also keen on Elixir, Lua, TypeScript and other languages where applicable.
